# How to start service

- To start the application, you just need to run the Docker Compose file. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

- Run the following command:
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

- Both the database and the app server will now be running. You can call any API using the default server port 3000.

- Notes:
  - Due to time constraints, test cases are not included. However, all other requirements mentioned in the task description have been completed.
